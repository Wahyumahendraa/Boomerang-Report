### **7. PYTD vs YTD Revenue**

The revenue trajectory tells a story of resilience, with clear signs of recovery after 2019.
After peaking at **\$932M** in 2018, revenue dropped sharply to **\$302M YTD** in 2019, marking a significant slowdown. Yet, this low point became the foundation for a strong rebound.

The years **2020**, **2022**, and **2024** show solid YTD growth compared to their respective PYTD figures, reflecting **positive year-over-year momentum**:

- **2020:** YTD revenue rose to **\$926M**, up from **\$302M** in 2019.
- **2022:** Continued growth with **\$1.02B YTD**, compared to **\$730M** in 2021.
- **2024:** Although early in the year, YTD revenue has already reached **\$42M**, surpassing the same period in 2023 (**\$39M**), suggesting a potential upward trend.

However, **2023** disrupted this pattern, with YTD revenue falling to **\$409M** from **\$1.02B** the previous year, indicating possible market disruption or internal challenges.

### **8. YoY Growth**

After a strong performance in previous years, the business hit **a low point in 2019**, recording a sharp **-67.56%** decline—the biggest drop so far. However, this became a turning point. **In 2020, the business made a strong recovery**, with growth jumping to **+206.36%**, showing its ability to bounce back quickly from setbacks.

The momentum didn’t fully carry through to **2021**, where the business experienced a **-21.10%** dip—an expected correction after such a sharp rise. But in **2022**, growth returned at **+39.72%**, suggesting renewed strength in operations and market traction.

However, **2023** brought another setback with a **-59.88%** decline, hinting at market pressure or internal bottlenecks that disrupted progress.
